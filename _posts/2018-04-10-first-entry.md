# First blog entry

Hello! This is the first post of my blog. I've started this project as a way to share my livings and experiences. I plan on posting quite often, but I won't follow any regular pattern.

### The blog

The blog will not be thematic by any means. I will write about programming, travelling, music and random themes that interest me. I have been interested on writing a blog for a while now, and I think it's the perfect moment to start it up.

### The website

This blog is a part of a whole [personal website](../../../index.html) I've started building. The website is completed *(from a programming standpoint)* , but I haven't filled it up yet. I have to sum up all the info I want to upload and give it the correct format before updating the site.

### About me

I'm Javier Rodr√≠guez, a 21 year old computer science student from Valencia, Spain. I'm currently working at [ITI](https://www.iti.es/) as an intern, while finishing my degree. I will provide more info about myself when [the main page](../../../index.html) is finally completed.

#### Thanks

Anyway, thanks for reading this first entry and stay tuned for more updates!
