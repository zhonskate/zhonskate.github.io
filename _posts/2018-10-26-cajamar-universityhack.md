# Cajamar Universityhack 2018

Hi everyone! Long time without posting.

Just wanted to share the results of last year's Cajamar's Datathon called Univeristyhack. Inscriptions for this year just opened, more info [here](http://www.cajamardatalab.com/datathon-cajamar-universityhack-2019/).

Anyway, I participated with two of my colleagues in the prediction category last year. The problem consisted in predicting people's acquisitive power based on a series of unlabeled variables.

The competition was open for the university students throughout the whole country. We got to the finals in madrid, where we ended up in [second place](http://www.cajamardatalab.com/datathon-cajamar-universityhack-2018/ganadores/) on our challenge.
